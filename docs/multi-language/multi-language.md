## What is Multi Language?

_**This plugin supports different languages per player.**_

Currently only english messages are available by default.

We accept translated messages to add even more languages to the official messages.
You can submit translated messages on our Discord server!

## How to add more language?

The normal and GUI messages are the same.

1. You need to put another messages <lang\>.yml file in the languages folder.
2. Restart your server.
3. Now players can use their preferred languages.
